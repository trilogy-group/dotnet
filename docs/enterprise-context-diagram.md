# Enterprise Context diagram

An Enterprise Context diagram is really the same as the [System Context diagram](system-context-diagram.md), without a focus on a specific software system. It can help to provide a broader view of the people and software systems that are related to and reside within a given enterprise context (e.g. a business or organisation).

## Example

As an example, an Enterprise Context diagram for a simplified, fictional Internet Banking System might look something like this. In summary, it shows more than just the immediate relationships of the Internet Banking System.

With Structurizr for .NET, you can create this diagram with code like the following:

```c#
Person customer = model.AddPerson(Location.External, "Customer", "A customer of the bank.");
    
SoftwareSystem internetBankingSystem = model.AddSoftwareSystem(Location.Internal, "Internet Banking System", "Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts and make payments.");
customer.Uses(internetBankingSystem, "Uses");
    
SoftwareSystem mainframeBankingSystem = model.AddSoftwareSystem(Location.Internal, "Mainframe Banking System", "Stores all of the core banking information about customers, accounts, transactions, etc.");
internetBankingSystem.Uses(mainframeBankingSystem, "Uses");
    
SoftwareSystem atm = model.AddSoftwareSystem(Location.Internal, "ATM", "Allows customers to withdraw cash.");
atm.Uses(mainframeBankingSystem, "Uses");
customer.Uses(atm, "Withdraws cash using");
    
Person bankStaff = model.AddPerson(Location.Internal, "Bank Staff", "Staff within the bank.");
bankStaff.Uses(mainframeBankingSystem, "Uses");

EnterpriseContextView enterpriseContextView = views.CreateEnterpriseContextView("EnterpriseContext", "The system context diagram for the Internet Banking System.");
enterpriseContextView.AddAllElements();
```
